        "A CPU (Central Processing Unit) and a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) are both types of processors, but they are designed for different types of workloads.\n",
        "\n",
        "A CPU is designed to handle a wide variety of tasks, such as running the operating system, executing application programs, and performing complex calculations. A CPU typically has a small number of cores, which are optimized for sequential execution of instructions, and a large cache memory to hold frequently used data.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a GPU is designed to handle large amounts of data in parallel. A GPU has a large number of cores, which are optimized for executing the same instruction on multiple pieces of data in parallel. GPUs also have a large amount of memory called VRAM (Video RAM) that holds the data that the cores are working on.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, a CPU is better suited for tasks that require sequential execution of instructions and complex branching operations, while a GPU is better suited for tasks that can be parallelized, such as image processing, scientific simulations, and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a program is executed on a CPU it's called serial execution, while when a program is executed on a GPU it's called parallel execution. A GPU can perform the same operation on thousands of data points at the same time, this means that a GPU can perform certain tasks much faster than a CPU, specially when the task can be parallelized.\n",
        "\n",
        "In recent years, with the rise of deep learning and AI, the use of GPUs for general purpose computation (GPGPU) has increased, and many libraries and frameworks for deep learning such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe and others are optimized to run on GPUs to accelerate the computation."
